        <p>When I became your First Minister last year, I knew that we had some work to do. Voters across Wales were making it clear to me that you felt we had lost touch – that your Government needed to refocus.</p>
        <p>That is why the <em>first thing</em> I did was to embark on a listening tour. I came to your high streets, community centres, schools, hospitals and more to hear from you about the things that you thought the Government should be doing. And in doing so, I came up with a list of four priorities – detailed down below – that you wanted the Government to focus on.</p>
        <p>And then I got to work.</p>
        <p>In the months since, my Government has been making things happen, delivering on those priorities, and below you can find everything we have done so far.</p>
        <p>I've listened, I've heard. And now, I'm making things happen.</p>
